4.2.1: |
  Hotfix release
  
  - fixed custom urls not working properly, when the replacement was in the path part of the URL

4.2.0: |
  Valve continues to update Steam and fully rebuild it in React. The recent wishlist update they did was just that.
  Even though it looks the same as the old version, everything has changed and works in a very different way. 
  That provides some new challenges for us, and we expect them to continue page by page in a similar fashion.
  
  That said, this update brings the most of the Wishlist functionality back, hopefully Steam won't break it again too quickly.
  
  Some of the site-wide common features were not yet ported over (the removal of trademarks from names, for example),
  and some of the things may no longer be possible. A known issue is that if you change your rank in any of the sorting
  other than "Your rank", and then go back to that one, Steam won't update your ranking automatically,
  becase we can no longer easily attach to Steam's code and tell it that something has changed (the other way works fine).

  Some other non-wishlist changes:
  - fixed custom links that contained &
  - fixed store assets, using new CDN
  - fixed missing FKeepSSACheckboxState in register key context 

4.1.2: |
  Bugfix release
  
  - fixed ITAD sync. Turns out, sync was like, entirely broken. Most of the time. It should be fixed now and sync should sync again.
  - added Sync Events to options to see what and when was actually synced
  - fixed context menus ceasing to work after few minutes 
  - fixed Achievements sorting. Again
  - fixed profile wishlist count for languages other than English
  - fixed DLC checkbox for "recommended DLC"
  - added support for Trending Free as a default home page tab

4.1.1: |

4.0.0: |
  Major extension rewrite, that doesn't look like much.
  
  Google is forcing Manifest v3 on everyone, and so if we want Augmented Steam to keep working in Chrome, we had to comply.
  We took that chance and also improved our code base, but besides Options being a little bit different,
  you should not notice many other changes.
