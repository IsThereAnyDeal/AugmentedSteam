2.0.0: |
  A new major version! If you're going to read a changelog, you might wonder what did we do to deserve the version 2.
  Well, we have completely overhauled our code base, so Augmented Steam is now much easier to maintain and iterate upon.
  We apologize for a long wait :)

  What's new:
  - We have much nicer logo now (priorities!)
  - You can now completely remove broadcasts from app pages
  - When exporting wishlists, we will respect your filter selection, you deserve it

  What's fixed:
  - Improved replacement of your account name with your community name
  - Fixed rendering bugs on achievement comparison page
  - Features on wishlist page should now work all the time, we had a talk
  - Background preview will now work, even when background is animated
  - Fixed silent fails of key activation dialog
  - We will now remember your agreement with Steam Subscriber agreement on Community Market
  - Fixed monochrome Tux icon

  Known issues:
  - YouTube deprecated the method we were using to display review and gameplay videos.
    We have yet to implement an alternative method, until then the YouTube features are disabled.
  - If you are not able to save any new user notes, this is because you are running out of storage limits.
    We have a plan to fix that, but it's not yet implemented.

  Integration with IsThereAnyDeal (BETA)

  Furthermore, it allows you to import games from your Steam Library and/or Wishlist to IsThereAnyDeal, for improved accuracy (e.g. DLCs or unlisted games).
  Currently this feature can only add titles, not remove them, so it's not the replacement for IsThereAnyDeal's integrated sync, but an addition to it.
