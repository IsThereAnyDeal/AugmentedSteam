Enhanced Steam, an IsThereAnyDeal fork
==============

This is a fork of Enhanced Steam extension.

This is an extension repository, find [server repository here](https://github.com/tfedor/Enhanced_Steam_API_Server).

We are commited to continue it's development, after the [original extension](https://github.com/jshackles/Enhanced_Steam) has ended its life.

Visit [extension's page](https://es.isthereanydeal.com/) or our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/yn57q7f) for more info. 

Current state
-------

We have decided to rebuild the extension from the ground up, right now we are aiming to reach feature parity.
Most of the store features should be done, community features are still in works.
